# Project Euler Problems in D

##### Every once in a while I solve a project euler problem in D, and I learn something in the process of implementing the solutions.

##### I treat these as something of a Lingua D per se Illustrata -- ways for me to use (with the goal of mastering) file imports, array slices, and other neat features of D.
